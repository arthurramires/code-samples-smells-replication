================================================================================
MAJOR FINDINGS & INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. COMMUNITY STRUCTURE & CODE QUALITY RELATIONSHIP
   - Bus Factor (knowledge distribution) is NEGATIVELY correlated with code smells
   - Org Silo (structural separation) is NEGATIVELY correlated with code smells
   - These suggest well-organized projects (with intentional silos or distributed
     knowledge) have lower smell density

2. SMELL TYPES SHOW DIFFERENT PATTERNS
   - Design Smells INCREASE with commit count (rho=0.183, p<0.001)
   - Implementation Smells DECREASE with bus factor (rho=-0.275, p<0.001)
   - Magic Numbers show strongest correlations with social factors
   
3. CODE QUALITY IS TEMPORALLY STABLE
   - Kruskal-Wallis: H=0.165, p=0.997 (no year differences)
   - Friedman test shows no changes in social metrics over 5 years
   - Absolute smell counts vary, but relative patterns persist

4. COMMUNITY SMELLS PREDICT QUALITY PATTERNS
   - Repos WITH org_silo have 65% FEWER code smells (p=0.028)
   - Repos WITH org_silo have 74% FEWER impl smells (p=0.008)
   - Lone Wolf effect on implementation smells: p=0.022

5. CONSISTENCY ACROSS SCALES
   - Temporal (5-year) correlations match cross-sectional correlations
   - CommitCount × CodeSmells: consistent rho~0.45 across years
   - AuthorCount × CodeSmells: consistent rho~0.25 across years

6. TEAM DYNAMICS
   - Median team size: 2 authors per project (very small)
   - Very wide range: 0-1,842 authors (includes large-scale projects)
   - Bus Factor median: 0.9 (high concentration of knowledge)
   - Timezone disparity common: Median 2 timezones, range 0-26

7. OUTLIER PATTERNS
   - 6 repos show EXTREME smell burden (M=2664 smells)
   - These are high-activity projects with large teams
   - Suggests code quality degradation in very large projects
